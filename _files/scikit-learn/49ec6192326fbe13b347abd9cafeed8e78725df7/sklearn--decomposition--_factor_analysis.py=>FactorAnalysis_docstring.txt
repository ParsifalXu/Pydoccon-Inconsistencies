Factor Analysis (FA).

A simple linear generative model with Gaussian latent variables.

The observations are assumed to be caused by a linear transformation of
lower dimensional latent factors and added Gaussian noise.
Without loss of generality the factors are distributed according to a
Gaussian with zero mean and unit covariance. The noise is also zero mean
and has an arbitrary diagonal covariance matrix.

If we would restrict the model further, by assuming that the Gaussian
noise is even isotropic (all diagonal entries are the same) we would obtain
:class:`PPCA`.

FactorAnalysis performs a maximum likelihood estimate of the so-called
`loading` matrix, the transformation of the latent variables to the
observed ones, using SVD based approach.

Parameters
----------
n_components : int, default=None
    Dimensionality of latent space, the number of components
    of ``X`` that are obtained after ``transform``.
    If None, n_components is set to the number of features.

tol : float, defaul=1e-2
    Stopping tolerance for log-likelihood increase.

copy : bool, default=True
    Whether to make a copy of X. If ``False``, the input X gets overwritten
    during fitting.

max_iter : int, default=1000
    Maximum number of iterations.

noise_variance_init : ndarray of shape (n_features,), default=None
    The initial guess of the noise variance for each feature.
    If None, it defaults to np.ones(n_features).

svd_method : {'lapack', 'randomized'}, default='randomized'
    Which SVD method to use. If 'lapack' use standard SVD from
    scipy.linalg, if 'randomized' use fast ``randomized_svd`` function.
    Defaults to 'randomized'. For most applications 'randomized' will
    be sufficiently precise while providing significant speed gains.
    Accuracy can also be improved by setting higher values for
    `iterated_power`. If this is not sufficient, for maximum precision
    you should choose 'lapack'.

iterated_power : int, default=3
    Number of iterations for the power method. 3 by default. Only used
    if ``svd_method`` equals 'randomized'.

rotation : {'varimax', 'quartimax'}, default=None
    If not None, apply the indicated rotation. Currently, varimax and
    quartimax are implemented. See
    `"The varimax criterion for analytic rotation in factor analysis"
    <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02289233>`_
    H. F. Kaiser, 1958.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=0
    Only used when ``svd_method`` equals 'randomized'. Pass an int for
    reproducible results across multiple function calls.
    See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

Attributes
----------
components_ : ndarray of shape (n_components, n_features)
    Components with maximum variance.

loglike_ : list of shape (n_iterations,)
    The log likelihood at each iteration.

noise_variance_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
    The estimated noise variance for each feature.

n_iter_ : int
    Number of iterations run.

mean_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
    Per-feature empirical mean, estimated from the training set.

Examples
--------
>>> from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
>>> from sklearn.decomposition import FactorAnalysis
>>> X, _ = load_digits(return_X_y=True)
>>> transformer = FactorAnalysis(n_components=7, random_state=0)
>>> X_transformed = transformer.fit_transform(X)
>>> X_transformed.shape
