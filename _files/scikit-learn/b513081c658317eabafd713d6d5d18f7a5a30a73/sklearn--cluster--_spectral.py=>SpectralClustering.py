class SpectralClustering(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized Laplacian.

    In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of
    the individual clusters is highly non-convex or more generally when
    a measure of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable
    description of the complete cluster. For instance when clusters are
    nested circles on the 2D plane.

    If affinity is the adjacency matrix of a graph, this method can be
    used to find normalized graph cuts.

    When calling ``fit``, an affinity matrix is constructed using either
    kernel function such the Gaussian (aka RBF) kernel of the euclidean
    distanced ``d(X, X)``::

            np.exp(-gamma * d(X,X) ** 2)

    or a k-nearest neighbors connectivity matrix.

    Alternatively, using ``precomputed``, a user-provided affinity
    matrix can be used.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The dimension of the projection subspace.

    eigen_solver : {'arpack', 'lobpcg', 'amg'}, default=None
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities. If None, then ``'arpack'`` is
        used.

    n_components : int, default=n_clusters
        Number of eigen vectors to use for the spectral embedding

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization of the
        lobpcg eigen vectors decomposition when ``eigen_solver='amg'`` and by
        the K-Means initialization. Use an int to make the randomness
        deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
        n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

    gamma : float, default=1.0
        Kernel coefficient for rbf, poly, sigmoid, laplacian and chi2 kernels.
        Ignored for ``affinity='nearest_neighbors'``.

    affinity : str or callable, default='rbf'
        How to construct the affinity matrix.
         - 'nearest_neighbors' : construct the affinity matrix by computing a
           graph of nearest neighbors.
         - 'rbf' : construct the affinity matrix using a radial basis function
           (RBF) kernel.
         - 'precomputed' : interpret ``X`` as a precomputed affinity matrix.
         - 'precomputed_nearest_neighbors' : interpret ``X`` as a sparse graph
           of precomputed nearest neighbors, and constructs the affinity matrix
           by selecting the ``n_neighbors`` nearest neighbors.
         - one of the kernels supported by
           :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_kernels`.

        Only kernels that produce similarity scores (non-negative values that
        increase with similarity) should be used. This property is not checked
        by the clustering algorithm.

    n_neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors to use when constructing the affinity matrix using
        the nearest neighbors method. Ignored for ``affinity='rbf'``.

    eigen_tol : float, default=0.0
        Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix
        when ``eigen_solver='arpack'``.

    assign_labels : {'kmeans', 'discretize'}, default='kmeans'
        The strategy to use to assign labels in the embedding
        space. There are two ways to assign labels after the laplacian
        embedding. k-means can be applied and is a popular choice. But it can
        also be sensitive to initialization. Discretization is another approach
        which is less sensitive to random initialization.

    degree : float, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

    coef0 : float, default=1
        Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    kernel_params : dict of str to any, default=None
        Parameters (keyword arguments) and values for kernel passed as
        callable object. Ignored by other kernels.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run when `affinity='nearest_neighbors'`
        or `affinity='precomputed_nearest_neighbors'`. The neighbors search
        will be done in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    affinity_matrix_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Affinity matrix used for clustering. Available only if after calling
        ``fit``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0],
    ...               [4, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6]])
    >>> clustering = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2,
    ...         assign_labels="discretize",
    ...         random_state=0).fit(X)
    >>> clustering.labels_
    array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> clustering
    SpectralClustering(assign_labels='discretize', n_clusters=2,
        random_state=0)

    Notes
    -----
    If you have an affinity matrix, such as a distance matrix,
    for which 0 means identical elements, and high values means
    very dissimilar elements, it can be transformed in a
    similarity matrix that is well suited for the algorithm by
    applying the Gaussian (RBF, heat) kernel::

        np.exp(- dist_matrix ** 2 / (2. * delta ** 2))

    Where ``delta`` is a free parameter representing the width of the Gaussian
    kernel.

    Another alternative is to take a symmetric version of the k
    nearest neighbors connectivity matrix of the points.

    If the pyamg package is installed, it is used: this greatly
    speeds up computation.
