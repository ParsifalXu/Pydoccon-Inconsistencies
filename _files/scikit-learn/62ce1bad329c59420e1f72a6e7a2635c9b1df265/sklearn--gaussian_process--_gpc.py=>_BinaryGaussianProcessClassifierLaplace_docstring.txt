Returns log-marginal likelihood of theta for training data.

In the case of multi-class classification, the mean log-marginal
likelihood of the one-versus-rest classifiers are returned.

Parameters
----------
theta : array-like of shape (n_kernel_params,), default=None
    Kernel hyperparameters for which the log-marginal likelihood is
    evaluated. In the case of multi-class classification, theta may
    be the  hyperparameters of the compound kernel or of an individual
    kernel. In the latter case, all individual kernel get assigned the
    same theta values. If None, the precomputed log_marginal_likelihood
    of ``self.kernel_.theta`` is returned.

eval_gradient : bool, default=False
    If True, the gradient of the log-marginal likelihood with respect
    to the kernel hyperparameters at position theta is returned
    additionally. Note that gradient computation is not supported
    for non-binary classification. If True, theta must not be None.

clone_kernel : bool, default=True
    If True, the kernel attribute is copied. If False, the kernel
    attribute is modified, but may result in a performance improvement.

Returns
-------
log_likelihood : float
    Log-marginal likelihood of theta for training data.

log_likelihood_gradient : ndarray of shape (n_kernel_params,), optional
    Gradient of the log-marginal likelihood with respect to the kernel
    hyperparameters at position theta.
    Only returned when `eval_gradient` is True.
